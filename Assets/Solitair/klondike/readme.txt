Klondike Solitaire

-----------------------



Hello and thanks for buying klondike solitaire.
This project contains a complete klondike solitaire game.

Just start the menu scene. 
The source code is heavily commented to help you to extend it.


Each setting can be done in the options dialog.
The card pictures can be swapped easily - just replace the folder Resources/Textures/Set2.


If you have any issues with the project, just drop me line at jens@jensgaulke.de.
